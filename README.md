#data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [Telegraph Academy](http://telegraphacademy.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

# How to use this repository
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. To view this repository, open either of the `SpecRunner.html` files in your Chrome browser (there is one inside each of the sprint-one  and sprint-two folders).

# About this repository
In part-one, we re-implemented the stack and queue data structures from scratch in each of the following instantiation patterns:
  1. functional
  2. functional-shared
  3. prototypal
  4. pseudoclassical

In part-two, we re-implemented the following data structures from scratch:
  1. binary search tree
  2. graph
  3. hash table
  4. linked list
  5. set
  6. tree

When viewing this repository in the browser, you will see a series of tests with either a green checkmark or a red x denoting whether the implementation of a particular data structure is correct or not.
